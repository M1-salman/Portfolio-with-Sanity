# Project Title

A portfolio website using Next.js and Sanity CMS 

# Description

It is a portfolio website that shows my projects dynamically. In this project using Sanity CMS, it helps a lot to structure my content just using schemas, and on the home page, it has a "My Projects" section that shows my projects, which I created using Sanity.

# what's new learning for me

1. In this project, I learned about typescript and its types, and I know typescript is good to use because it saves a lot of time.

2. This was the first time I worked with a CMS, and it was a great experience for me because it gave you a platform on which you could structure your content easily.

3. I used Tailwind CSS first time , and it was a great choice to design your website. It gave you the freedom and ability to easily create custom designs and components.
